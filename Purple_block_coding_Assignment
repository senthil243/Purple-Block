Question:
if this a list of prices [5,2,1,6,9,7] and you have to create a function which will give me the best buy price and the best sell prices (1 and 9) to maximise my profit ?
Answer:
def best_buy_sell(prices):
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    buy_price = sell_price = 0
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price 
        if price - min_price > max_profit:
            max_profit = price - min_price
            buy_price = min_price  
            sell_price = price  
    return buy_price, sell_price
prices = [5, 2, 1, 6, 9, 7]
buy, sell = best_buy_sell(prices)
print("Best Buy Price:", buy) 
print("Best Sell Price:", sell)
