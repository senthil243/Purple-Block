Question:
if this a list of prices [5,2,1,6,9,7] and you have to create a function which will give me the best buy price and the best sell prices (1 and 9) to maximise my profit ?
Answer:
def best_buy_sell(prices):
    buy = min(prices)
    sell = max(prices[prices.index(buy):])
    return buy,sell
prices = [5,2,1,6,9,7]
buy,sell = best_buy_sell(prices)
print("Best_Buy_Price:",buy)
print("Best_Sell_Price:",sell)
